Generally we have two types of programming languages:
1. static type programming languages:
ex: Go,C .,
# in this languages we have define the variables using datatypes
int a = 19
2. Dynamic type programming languages:
ex: python
# in this languages we no need define the variables using datatypes, 
we can define the variables directly
ex: a = 19
    name = "radha"
